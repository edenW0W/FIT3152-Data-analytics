# Lecture 1 Introduction to R

## Syntax basics

  R is command line driven, or using scripts:

```R
> Indicates a new line, Continued lines by +
```

  R is case sensitive:

```R
> TheData is different to thedata
```

  Assignment:

```R
> Use: x < â€“ 5 or x = 5 to assign a value to variable x
```

  Commenting:

```R
> # denotes a comment. Anything on the line after this point is ignored.
```

## Console, Variables, Function

The R Console shows the command line interface
R can be used for direct calculation and interprets
each line as you press (Enter/Return) key, thus:

```R
> 1 + 4 (enter)
  [1] 5
```

Create variables by assigning a value to a name:

```R
> X = 7
```

Call functions by name:

```R
> X = sqrt(7)
```
