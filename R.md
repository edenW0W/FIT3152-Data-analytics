# Lecture 1 Introduction to R

## Syntax basics

  R is command line driven, or using scripts:

    > Indicates a new line, Continued lines by +

  R is case sensitive:

    > TheData is different to thedata

  Assignment:

    > Use: x < â€“ 5 or x = 5 to assign a value to variable x

  Commenting:

    > # denotes a comment. Anything on the line after this point is ignored.

## Console, Variables, Function

The R Console shows the command line interface
R can be used for direct calculation and interprets
each line as you press (Enter/Return) key, thus

  1 + 4 (enter)
    [1] 5

Create variables by assigning a value to a name
> X = 7
Call functions by name
> X = sqrt(7)
